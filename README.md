<h1>🛡️ Tower Defense Thesis Project - Unity 2D </h1>


<h2>Description</h2>
🎓 This project was developed as part of my undergraduate thesis.  
It is a fully functional **2D Tower Defense** game prototype built with **Unity** and **C#**, designed with modular architecture and expandable gameplay mechanics.


<h2> 🎯 Goal of the project </h2>
The main objective was to create a structured and testable gameplay system that simulates a Tower Defense experience with:
- Wave spawning system
- Modular turret logic (including Elemental towers)
- Upgradeable defenses
- Score and leaderboard tracking
- UI/UX interaction management
- Player name input and session saving

<h2> Technologies used </h2>

- Unity 2022+
- C# (MonoBehaviour patterns, events, singletons)
- TextMeshPro
- Unity UI
- Git for version control

<h2>Status & Future Plans </h2>

Although developed as an academic project, I plan to **gradually upgrade it** in my free time by adding:
- New visual assets and animations
- Boss enemies and more tower types
- Mobile-friendly UI
- Save/load system
- Theme switching (sci-fi, fantasy etc.)
